## Exploring Customer Experience with British Airways
### Content
You can follow the notebooks that I have made in order to completely explore how I manage to finish the project.
- [Task 1.1 - Web Scraping.ipynb](https://github.com/dstito/Exploring-Customer-Experience-and-Predicting-Customer-Booking-Behaviour/blob/main/Task%201.1%20-%20Web%20Scraping.ipynb)
  - **Data Collection** via Web Scraping Process, to get the data from a third-party source.
  - **Data Wrangling**, to make sure the data is ready and easy to be analyzed.
- [Task 1.2 - Exploring Customer Experience.ipynb](https://github.com/dstito/Exploring-Customer-Experience-and-Predicting-Customer-Booking-Behaviour/blob/main/Task%201.2%20-%20Exploring%20Customer%20Experience.ipynb)
  - **Data Profiling**, to get more understanding about the data.
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis**, to uncover meaningful insights within the data.
  - **Topic Modeling** with Latent Dirichlet allocation model, to identify clusters/groups/topics within the data.
  - **Recommendation**, to provide some strategic recommendations for British Airways.
### Final Result
